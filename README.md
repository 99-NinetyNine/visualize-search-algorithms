# Graph Algorithms Visualization in JavaScript

This project implements Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm in JavaScript. The visualization is done using the vis.js library.

## Features

- **Graph Visualization:**
  - Display the graph using vis.js.

- **DFS Algorithm:**
  - Depth-First Search algorithm implementation with visualization.

- **BFS Algorithm:**
  - Breadth-First Search algorithm implementation with visualization.

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:**
  - Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm implementation with visualization.
